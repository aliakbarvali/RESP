With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks in smart cities, the inevitable generation of massive
amounts of data, commonly known as big data, has introduced increased latency within the traditional cloud computing paradigm. In
response to this challenge, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as a viable solution, offloading a portion of mobile device
workloads to nearby edge servers equipped with ample computational resources. Despite significant research in mobile edge computing,
optimizing the placement of edge servers in smart cities to enhance network performance has received little attention. In this paper,
we propose RESP, a novel Recursive clustering technique for Edge Server Placement in MEC environments. RESP performs based
on the median of each cluster determined by the number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs), strategically placing edge servers to
achieve workload balance and minimize network traffic between them. Our proposed clustering approach substantially improves load
balancing compared to existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in handling traffic dynamics. Through experimental
evaluation with real-world data from Shanghai Telecom’s base station dataset, our approach outperforms several representative
techniques in terms of workload balancing and network traffic optimization. By addressing the ESP problem and introducing an
advanced recursive clustering technique, this work makes a substantial contribution to optimizing mobile edge computing networks in
smart cities. The proposed algorithm outperforms alternative methodologies, demonstrating a 10% average improvement in optimizing
network traffic. Moreover, it achieves a 53% more suitable result in terms of computational load.
